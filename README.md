# Music Player
--------------

## Introduction

Various music player apps have been created as a result of technological advancements. 
These apps offer a wide range of features and functionalities. 
Some apps, however, charge a monthly subscription fee to remove advertisements.
But Python makes it possible for us to create a functional music player for free.
So, in this project, we'll utilize its tools to build an MP3 player.

## How to Setup
We must first get all the prerequisites ready in order for this project to succeed.

  * Install `Python 3.11.0` for **pip**,  **tcl/tk**, and **IDLE** <br />
  * Copy the installation directory. e.g. `C:\Python\Python311` <br />
  * Add the directory in ***PATH*** environent variable. <br />
  * Go to terminal and `pip install pygame`.
  
Check to see if Python and a code editor are both installed on your computer. <br />
To determine whether Python is installed, use the command listed below.  <br />
***python --version***

Regardless of the OS you are using, this command will function.
